React.js and vanilla CSS is used for this project. The project is a simple dropdown menu with a few options. The dropdown menu is a reusable component as well. The reason I choose to not use Tailwind CSS is because the project is rather simple and does not require additional CSS libraries. However, I have experience working with similar libraries such as Bootstrap and Material UI. The reason I choose React.js is because I am used to the React.js framework. I believe the skills are transferable to other frameworks such as Angular and Vue.js. I altered the dropdown slightly from the example given by displaying the selected options in the input bar as it is easier for users to see which options are being selected. Users can still click the selected option in the result window to unselect that option. The theme I choose for the project is dark mode which explains the colours used. Also I did not uses Popper.js as I felt that the positioning of the search result window is good enough and I managed to impmelent the isLoading without Lodash. 

To run the project, simply run `npm start` in the terminal. The project will be hosted on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
